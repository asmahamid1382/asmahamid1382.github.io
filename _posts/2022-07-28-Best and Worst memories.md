## django project 
### this was one of my best experiences so far I made my first web app using django 
* [Here is the link to my app ](http://400522364.pythonanywhere.com/)

## getting to know TA 
### getting to know students with more experienve than me was very helpfull.

## C exam 
### I didnt perform very well at this exam and I didnt feel good during the exam so it was not very good memory.
